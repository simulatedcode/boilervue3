# Boilerplate-vue

This is a basic boilerplate setup for Vue 3 using TypeScript.

In addition to the features mentioned above, this Vue3-TypScript boilerplate also provides an easier development workflow and streamlined deployment to Firebase Hosting and Firestore. With Firebase tools integrated into this boilerplate, developers can easily deploy their applications with just a few simple commands.

Firebase Hosting allows developers to quickly and easily deploy their web applications to a global CDN with HTTPS support. Firestore, on the other hand, provides a real-time NoSQL database that can be easily integrated with the front-end application. With this boilerplate, developers can take advantage of these Firebase services and streamline their development and deployment process.

- **TypeScript** - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **antfu's Vue 3 preset** - using `unplugin-vue-components`, `unplugin-auto-import` and `unocss`.
